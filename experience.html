                    I worked here during Christmas period, it was great helping people find party dresses and gifts. Ensuring things are organized, taking a mental note of where everything is and what sales are on when coming in for the shift. And of course COVID being ever present, a lot of wipe downs and social distancing reminders.
                    Overall, the definition of fun while working, with the team and manager being supportive.

                    Yes, this already has a blog <a href="https://adacomestocanada.blogspot.com/2020/05/professional-internship-experience.html" class="text-success"><strong>post</strong></a>, but this is another example of having an amazing team that prioritizes growth.
                    Space was my stream of choice, so instead of finite element analysis I did Intro to Space Robotics, essentially needed to learn fundamentals on the job. From my manager signing me up for trainings to my supervisor breaking things down and sharing helpful resources. Of course team lunches and the general environment was open.
                    Working in the Methods and Tools department also meant different tools, tasks and skills needed at various points of the lifecycle.

            <div class="w3-container" style="margin-top:75px">
                <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Research Assistant, SAIL</b></h1>
                <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
                <p> To date this is the position I grew the most in, I had a supportive lab and worked for an amazing Professor. Although it was in my toughest year of undergrad, it set the standard of work environments very high. The learning curve was steep, with the main goal to:
                    <blockquote> Improve existing MATLAB code by conducting tests on gearing/stepper ratios of motors, varying acceleration and speed limits using the tuff-tilt inclinometer to ensure proper calibration of software for sidereal coordinate system star tracking of an equatorial telescope mount.</blockquote>
                 <p> I literally started not knowing what sidereal tracking even meant.</p>
                <p>
                    Being given a chance to learn while working, with a team that prioritizes understanding in an environment that was so warm was a blessing, deserves a separate blogpost to be fair. 
                    Dr. Enright turned what should’ve been a huge failure to my greatest lesson. So I was tasked with testing the mount multiple times to ensure the code was responding correctly to commands, and the tuft-tilt inclinometer was the main measuring tool. 
                    Ahn. I literally tried pulling an all-nighter after figuring out how to automate the test process, not really paying attention to the results the inclinometer was giving. Time to share my findings and we notice there were slight differences in the orientation command and the inclinometer readings. 
                    Then as the researcher the Prof is, my next task was to find out the source of the error. Honestly the PhD student needed the inclinometer for something else and was so confused as to why the task was taking so long since the error was from my not giving some time between each command. 
                    Okay so that’s 2 lessons, because why didn’t I just ask for help from the expert or brainstorm at the very least? The main lesson was in understanding how to create test plans, tools being used and the value of sanity tests during the process as opposed to after hours of work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This experience also served as a wake up call, “DO NOT GHOST YOURSELF” is what I have at the back of my mind when I sense I am about to give up of stop trying. 
                    Something that started off as doing too much in the heaviest semester, turned into complacency, then the lie of “I’m too behind” then ghosting. 
                    Really all I needed to do was communicate the situation, and if I wasn’t working for such a patient/empathetic it would have been a different story. Ghosting is not an option, so be conscious of how much you can take on.

                    Graduated peak COVID so in hindsight this role gave me multiple graduation ceremonies to the point I don’t really feel like I missed much. 
                    I enjoyed the role, from breaks with friends, the different duties you can have within the same day, and just being around all the happy people. Watching the different ways people react was a thing in itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we did ranged from checking graduates in, arranging brochures, helping gown graduates, working the family room (for extra guests to watch ceremonies outside the hall), and helping cross-train volunteers. 
                    If fast paced was a place it would be here. Getting a behind the scenes view.

                    So, my secondary school had an IT initiative where senior students were encouraged to work in their fields of interest. My parents took it a bit too personal, especially as they wanted me to be a pharmacist. 
                    Might seem random to have this here but, it shaped my view of work to an extent. After the first placement at a pharmacy ended with me extremely sick for the rest of the holiday, I was placed-for IT- in the hospital.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some days I helped at the pharmacy, reception, or lab. I really enjoyed my time at the lab the most, learning and helping with tests (Malaria, Typhoid, Pregnancy being the most popular). 
                    I learned a lot and could link some to school as well. The reception was mainly finding files and greeting people.
